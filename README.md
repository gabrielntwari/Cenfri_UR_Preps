# Harnessing Machine Learning for Crop Yield Prediction in Rwanda: Unleashing the Power of Landsat 8 Satelite Imagery and Agriculture Season Survey

This workshop aims to equip the Masters Students at the University of Rwanda, Center of Excellence in Data Science with the application of machine learning in agriculture.

## Welcome Message

Dear Students;

Welcome to the exciting world of cutting-edge technology and its profound impact on agriculture.
Today, we are thrilled to introduce you to the fascinating field of machine learning and its application in crop yield prediction using the remarkable combination of Landsat 8 satellite imagery and agriculture season survey data.

## Introduction

As the world's population continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, ensuring global food security becomes an increasingly pressing challenge.
Agriculture, being the backbone of our sustenance, requires innovative technological solutions to maximize productivity and optimize resource utilization. 
This is where Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning steps in.

## Data Source

Machine learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, empowers researchers especially data scientists to develop intelligent systems capable of learning 
from data patterns and making accurate predictions basing on the learnt characteristics.
By leveraging the big amounts of time series data generated by Landsat 8 satellite sourced from different data repos, hence complemented with on-ground 
level agriculture season survey data, we can unlock invaluable insights into crop health, growth patterns, and ultimately, yield projections.

Landsat 8, a state-of-the-art satellite launched by NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), provides us with an unparalleled perspective 
of our planet's surface. Equipped with an array of sensors, Landsat 8 captures high-resolution imagery across various spectral bands, 
enabling us to analyze vegetation indices, soil moisture, land surface temperature, precipitation and other vital parameters essential for crop monitoring.

In conjunction with the satellite data, agricultural season survey data underaken by National Institute of Statistics in Rwanda, NISR adds a crucial layer 
of information.
By systematically collecting data on factors such as planting seasons, crop types, arable areas, fertilization schedules, irrigation techniques, pest management strategies, 
and other relevant agricultural practices, we can establish a comprehensive dataset that encompasses both environmental and agronomic variables.

## Method summary and Policy

Predictive Machine learning algorithms, when trained on this comprehensive rich dataset, can recognize intricate hidden patterns and relationships between different parameters and crop yields. Through advanced statistical modeling and predictive analytics, these algorithms can then generate
accurate crop yield predictions, helping farmers and policymakers make informed decisions related to resource allocation, harvest planning, food security and sound food price security.

## Expected Changes 

This interdisciplinary approach, merging remote sensing technology, data science, and agricultural expertise, presents an exciting opportunity to revolutionize traditional farming practices. By embracing machine learning in crop yield prediction, we can move towards a more sustainable and efficient agriculture industry, 
mitigating risks, optimizing inputs, and ultimately, increasing food production to meet the demands of a growing global population.

## Motivation

Throughout this career journey, we encourage you to explore the numerous applications and challenges associated with machine learning in agriculture. From understanding the nuances of satellite 
imagery analysis to delving into statistical modeling techniques, this field offers endless opportunities for research, innovation, and real-world impact that is 
relevantly transform societal life.

Please get ready to embark on an incredible adventure at the intersection of technology and agriculture as we delve into
the realm of machine learning for crop yield prediction using Landsat 8 satellite imagery and seasonal agriculture season survey data.

!!!! Let's unlock the full potential of data-driven agriculture and shape a more sustainable future together!
